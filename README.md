# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals  
# CSCI 5521: Machine Learning Fundamentals â€“ Spring 2025

This repository contains my programming assignments for **CSCI 5521: Machine Learning Fundamentals**, a graduate-level course offered at the **University of Minnesota** during **Spring 2025**. The course focuses on the foundational principles and practical implementation of key machine learning algorithms using Python and NumPy.

All code in this repository reflects my individual work and is intended to showcase my ability to translate machine learning theory into working code.
